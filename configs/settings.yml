  invalid_new_game: |
    Oops, {author}! Only the Chess Master (repo owner) can start a new game. 🤷‍♂️  
    Maybe challenge them to a duel in real life instead? 🎯🏆

  successful_new_game: |
    🎉 The chessboard is set, and the pieces are ready to dance! 💃🕺  
    It's White's move first... as tradition dictates. May the best player win! ♟️

  invalid_move_syntax: |
    Hmm... that doesn't seem right. 🤔  
    Try something like `Chess: Move e2 to e4`. Don't make me flip the board! 😠♻️

  invalid_fen: |
    Uh-oh, the board state looks a bit... broken. 🛠️  
    I tried loading the FEN: `{previousFen}`, but it was like deciphering hieroglyphs! 🔎  
    Can someone fix this mess? 😅

  invalid_move: |
    {src} to {dest}? Really? 😑 That's not a valid move!  
    Are you trying to invent a new chess rule or what? 😂 Try again.

  successful_move: |
    🏌️‍♂️ Move successful! {src} to {dest}. 👌  
    Next up: {nextTurn}'s turn. Time to show who's boss! 💪♜

  checkmate: |
    🔥🔥🔥 BOOM! Checkmate! {winner} emerges victorious! 👑  
    The opponent has been schooled in the art of chess-fu. 🎓♟️  
    GG WP! Ready for a rematch? 🥊

  draw: |
    😐 It's a draw. No winners, no losers... just two evenly matched masterminds.  
    Or maybe it was just dumb luck? 🤷 Let's go again and find out! ⚔️

  invalid_action: |
    🛑 HALT! That action isn't part of the chess manual. 📖  
    Either you're trying to hack the system or just experimenting... 🕵️‍♀️  
    Stick to the plan, and let's play chess! ♟️

  new_game: |
    🎲 The battle for the chess throne begins now! 👑  
    Time to summon the Chess Master (repo owner) and kickstart this epic duel. 🤺  
    No pressure, but the fate of the kingdom rests on this game! ⚔️🛡️
